# Êù±ÊñπÈõ®„ÅÆÂ•≥ ~ Uncover the Silvermist Fog! (Ver. 0.0.1a)
## Synopsis
Gensokyo is engulfed in a torrential rain! What once was thought to be a bothersome simple rain of the season, the denizens of this world were not prepared for the almost neverending downpour upon them. As a silvermist fog envelopes Gensokyo, our protagonists set out to resolve a potential major incident staring at them, ready to apprehend the culprit for their ruined plans.
