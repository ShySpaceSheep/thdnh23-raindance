# dnh-project-2022
A maintained version of the legacy danmakufu project I had last year. Now in active development, not sure where it's heading though.

## About
A Touhou Danmakufu project by ShySpaceSheep. No longer in development as there were issues with dated code and we've decided to just write the entire thing in scratch. Even if it's "finished", I doubt it would be a complete game. The whole thing's just messing around with Danmakufu, y'hear! However, that could change along the way, so keep an eye out for that!

# How To Play
## Installation
This repository is not pre-packaged with the Danmakufu program and thus needs to be installed by yourself. The repository only houses the script folder used to run the game.

[Install Danmakufu here](https://touhougc.web.fc2.com/products/th_dnh_ph3.html) to get started. The original page is in Japanese but what you're gonna need is just this:

This is the stable and final update to Danmakufu ph3, the engine the whole script is based on.

Once you have Danmakufu installed, replace the default `scripts` folder with the `script` folder provided by this repository. After doing so, run Danmakufu and playtest the various `Single`, `Plural`, `Stage`, and `Package` scripts. Note that in the stable release, this feature will be removed and you'll immediately be taken to custom dedicated `Package` script for the game.

## Controls
If you already played Touhou, all the same keys are the same for shooting, movement, prompt responses, etc..
However, if you haven't, here are the main controls you'll be using.
1. Movement Keys:
  - Forward = `↑` (Up Arrow Key)
  - Backward = `↓` (Down Arrow Key)
  - Left = `←` (Left Arrow Key)
  - Right = `→` (Right Arrow Key)
2. Player Actions:
  - Shoot = `Z`
  - Bomb = `X`
  - Utility = `C`
